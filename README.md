# Cortex-Debug: Device Support Pack - STM32H7 (forked)

This is an extension compatible with Cortex-Debug > v0.3.0, adds the necessary
SVD files for the STMicroelectronics STM32H7 MCU family.

This is a fork of https://github.com/jeandudey/cortex-debug-dp-stm32h7 that has
been updated with current SVD files for H7 processors from the STM32CubeIDE.

Note: The silicon revision "V" files have been removed
